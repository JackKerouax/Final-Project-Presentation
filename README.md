# Final Project

The final project is an opportunity to take your newly acquired audio programming skills in C to develop your very own piece of audio software. So long as your project draws upon the course materials, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. Please remember that your project does need to get approved by the instructor. Your audio software may be a game, synthesizer, audio effect, or a math or science application, or anything else you choose. This is a wide-open project, and you are expected to be creative in your approach to it. Build something that interests you and something that you can take with outside of this course.

## Starter Ideas
Here are just some of the ideas for your final project:

- Use PortAudio and PortMIDI to create a synthesizer
- Create an audio editor using [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/), [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/), and [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/)
- Use [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/), [fftw](http://fftw.org/), and [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/) to visualize audio in real-time
- Develop an audio streaming program using [ROC](https://roc-project.github.io/)
- Build a CLI program using C
- Integrate C program with Csound
- Write an algorithmic synthesis and music program
- Write a music application for microcontroller

## Schedule

Extensions on the final project are not ordinarily granted, except in cases of emergency.

### Proposal

*due by 11/20, 11:59*

The proposal is your opportunity to receive approval and counsel from your instructor before you proceed to design. Your instructor will either approve your proposal or require modifications for subsequent approval. Your proposal, even if approved, is not binding; you may alter your plan at any point, provided you obtain your instructor's consent for any modifications. Projects submitted without approval may not receive credit.

Answer the questions in the [Proposal/README.md](./Proposal/README.md) file. Submit your proposal (README.md) on the OL before the deadline.

### Status Report

*due by 12/4, 11:59*

Not only is the status report intended to keep the instructor apprised of your progress, but it is also an opportunity to keep yourself on track. Answer the questions in the [Status/README.md](./Status/README.md) file. Submit your proposal (README.md) on the OL before the deadline.

### Final Implementation

*due by 12/18, 11:59*

You must submit your software implementation and documentation of your final project via GitHub. Your submission thereof must include all of the below:

1. Documentation for your project in the form of README.md. This documentation is to be a user's manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the instructor how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for the instructor to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think someone might have while testing your work.

2. A "design document" for your project in the form of a Markdown file called DESIGN.md that discusses, technically, how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did. Your design document should be at least several paragraphs in length. Whereas your documentation is meant to be a user's manual, consider your design document your opportunity to give the instructor a technical tour of your project underneath its hood.

3. All files required to run your software, including source code as well as, if applicable, configuration files, Makefiles, sample inputs, SQLite databases, etc. All source code should be thoroughly commented.

4. A presentation file in the form of PowerPoint (.ppt) or Keynote (.key). Your presentation should have your name, project title, and details that you'd like to convey to your fellow classmates. A PDF file named [PresentationFormat.pdf](./PresentationFormat.pdf) is included as a guide for you to prepare your presentation. 

As the fourth point suggests, you will be presenting your final project during the last week of the semester. You will be required to demo your software during your 5 ~ 8 minutes presentation. If you are afraid that the live demo may not work during your presentation, you may want to consider videotaping your software in action before the last week of the semester and include it in your presentation. Please BRING YOUR LAPTOP to present your final project.

## Final Project Grading Rubric

**Total** | **100%**

## Submission Guideline
- Create a new GitHub project with the right name and problem set number (e.g., `LMSC261-ProblemSet1`).
- Commit and push Scratch files for this problem set into the newly created project.
- Submit the link to the repository on OL to complete the problem set.

## Submission policy:
- The final Project must be first committed and pushed to your GitHub repository. 
- The link to your repository must be submitted to OL to complete the project.
- Late submission will not be accepted.
- The final project is due by 11:59:59 pm on the day before the final class
