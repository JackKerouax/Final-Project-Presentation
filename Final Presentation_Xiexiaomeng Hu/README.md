# EP-353: Audio Programming in C (Fall 2019)

Final Project: Building a synthesizer with basic audio effects using PortAudio and PortMIDI in C.

This project will be mainly serving to explore the programming logic behind digital synthesizer, as well as getting familiar with the design concept of digital audio effects. The goal of this project basically serves as a synthesizer prototype, with the ability to generate simple wavefroms such as sine wave, square wave, triangle wave and sawtooth wave. 

Due to my limited syntex knowledge in C, I'm heavily relying on the Monosynth template provided in Week-13 course material. While I did study through each section of code in the monosynth template and I understand the basic workflow inside and was able to change certain parameters like waveform harmonics, bool sustain in Envelope.h, etc.

Idealy, the user should be able to play scales with simple audio effects such as distortion, delay, reverb, etc; on the synthesizer through MIDI signals. However, I only have the seperate monosynth and offtime audio effect and I wasn't able to achieve real time audio effect yet. If possible, I'd like to work on the rest of the features during winterbreaks, and submit a updated version before Spring semester.
